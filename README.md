*It is the 1400 century; A strange curse has unleashed a horde of demons and undead in the world. Everything is in a state of eternal chaos. Only few people have the power to defeat this treat and return the world to peaceful times. We play as two mages who possess an ancient power spell which creates a powerful blast which can purge ghosts and undead alike. But the spell is incomplete, the blast requires close proximity and the blast can only occur in the direction of the other mage. The mages must coordinate their movements and blasts to purge their enemies and free the world from the powerful curse.*
